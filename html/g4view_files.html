<div class="textblock"><p>The "files" menu item shows files of the "document directory" whose types are known by g4view. According to the platform, the document directory is : </p><pre class="fragment">     UNIX : ~/Documents/g4view
     Windows : C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\g4view
     Android : /sdcard/Android/data/fr.in2p3.lal.g4view
     iPod/iPhone/iPad : &lt;app dir&gt;/Documents.
</pre><p>The known file types are : </p><pre class="fragment">     .gdml : Geant4 GDML files describing a geometry.
     .mac : Geant4 macro file.
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="g4view_files_idevices"></a>
iPod/iPhone/iPad</h1>
<p>g4view is complient with the "Apple document interchange" protocol for file types known by g4view. Then applications as Dropbox, GoodReader, Mail can "Open in..." a file toward g4view. (Strangely it does not work with all file types from Safari. But it seems to be a common problem...) With this feature you can get data files without the need to connect your iDevice to a desktop.</p>
<p>From a Mac, as g4view had been declared as a "File Sharing" application, you can send data files from a Mac on a connected iDevice by : </p><pre class="fragment">      connecting it to a Mac
      launching iTune
      choose the device in the DEVICES list on the left
      choose the "apps" tab in the central panel
      choose g4view in the list of "File Sharing" apps
      use the "add..." button to send files on the device
</pre><p> Note that you can also send files by using from your Mac the free "iPhone Explorer" application. After having launched iPhone Explorer on your Mac, drag the wanted file (or directory in fact) from the Mac Finder onto the Documents directory of the device seen within the iPhone Explorer tree.</p>

Android</h1>
<p>g4view should appears as a candidate viewer when choosing a file in Dropbox or from the "Linda Manager" file manager application. (But it is not proposed as a candidate viewer from the "My Files" application on our device under Android 2.1). With this feature you can get data files without the need to connect your device to a desktop.</p>
<p>From a desktop you can nicely "push" files on a connected device by using on your desktop the "adb" tool coming from the Android SDK : </p><pre class="fragment">    &lt;source setup adb&gt;
    adb push &lt;file&gt; /sdcard/Android/data/fr.in2p3.lal.g4view/.
</pre><p> You can use also some free FTP app as the AndFTP one to get data files. </p>
