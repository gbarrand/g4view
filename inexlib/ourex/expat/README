 The code is the one of a 2.0.1.
 The copyright file found in this distribution had been copied under
 a_native_copyright.

 Changes :
 - rename xmltok_impl.c to xmltok_impl.ic
 - rename xmltok_ns.c to xmltok_ns.ic
 - remove the source/[win,mac,amiga]config.h to have one source/expat_config.h
 - move include/xmlrole.h,xmltok.h,xmltok_impl.h in source.
 - move expat.h to _expat.h to avoid conflict with native expat.h
 - have a ourex_rename.h to rename everything to be sure to not
   clash with native expat.
 - have a front-end ourex_expat.h including ourex_rename.h and _expat.h
 - rename the .cc files to .cpp files for Android.

 Todo :
 - in source/expat_config.h, handle BYTEORDER to the few remaining
   big endian platform (is there still some ?).
