  Modified version of gl2ps 1.3.2 to be able to compile
 with an OpenGL-ES (Android, iPhone) and be able
 to use gl2ps without having at hand the FEEDBACK buffer
 way of doing which is not available with OpenGL-ES.
 
  To compile and link with an OpenGL-ES, we have put a :
    #ifdef EXLIB_GL_GLES
 in gl2ps.h in order to "dummy #define" some GL_ cpp macros
 and have dummy versions of some gl functions not available
 in OpenGL-ES.

  We have made public, the functions :
 - gl2psAddPolyPrimitive
 in order to feed gl2ps (then without using the not available
 FEEDBACK way of doing) and then be able to produce output files.

  We have added :
 - gl2psSetBackgroundColor.
