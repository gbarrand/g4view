  First, you have to "source setup" your SDK and NDK development environment.
 If needed, edit the bush/setup/android.[sh,csh] to point to it. Then :
      sh> . ../../bush/setup/android.sh
 or with a csh flavoured shell :
     csh> source ../../bush/setup/android.csh

  When done, you build the application with :
    UNIX> ../../bush/and_build
  ( UNIX> ../../bush/and_build -j4 )

  NOTE : the jks password asked during the build to sign the .apk is 'android'.

  Obviously you need to have on your machine an Android SDK and NDK, and have
 the AndroidManifest.xml, [ant,local,project].properties, jni/Application.mk files
 tuned properly for these SDK/NDK and Android API. See the "Build for Android" section
 under the softinex portal for more
